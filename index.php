      <h2>What’s our purpose?</h2>
      <p><strong>We believe all young people deserve the opportunity to excel in life – regardless of their background, aspirations, learning styles, skills or interests.</strong></p>
      <p>Our work supports young people to focus on what matters to them and equips them with the self-belief and capability to fulfil their potential - regardless of their story so far.</p>
      <p>We’re here for the square pegs, the non-conformists, the ones that don’t fit the education system’s current mould - you can succeed and we’re to help you do so.</p>
